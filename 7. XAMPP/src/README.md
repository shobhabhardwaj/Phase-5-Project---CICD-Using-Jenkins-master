# XAMPP Server using HTML and PHP

XAMPP is a collection of software packages for server side settings developed by Apache.

XAMPP stands for:

* **X:** indicates that it works both for W (Windows) and L (Linux) type OS.
* **A:** stands for Apache
* **M:** stands for MySQL
* **P:** stands for PHP (Hypertext Pre-processor) , a server-side scripting language (similar to JavaScript which is client side scripting language)
* **P:** stands for PERL language

Thus, LAMP stack is a subset of XAMPP.

## Why XAMPP:

Unlike HTML which does not require any tool or special server to be compiled and give output, PHP needs server to work.
If PHP code is opened in web browser, it will just give simple source code because it does not understand it.

Thus, XAMPP creates a server hosted on **localhost/** on the current system on which PHP code can be referenced in the HTML code.

**Note:** PHP code runs on the Zend Engine compiler hosted on XAMPP.
**Note:** Stores file on **htdocs/** folder on XAMPP in C: drive. htdocs/ work as the root folder for localhost
**Note:** Execute programs by referecing them on web broswer.
Example: to run SimpleInterest.html stored on htdocs/ then on web browser, type:

```
localhost/SimpleInterest.html
```
